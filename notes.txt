Notes about the Access+ protocol

There are three ports which appear to be used by the client:

32770 - periodic broadcasts and notifications
32771 - unknown
49171 - share polling and other functions


A 24 byte block is periodically broadcast to all machines on the same
network (apparently, using the netmask 255.0.0.0, although for IP operation
this may just mean for all machines on the same subnet with netmask
255.255.255.0) for listeners on port 32770. This block contains something
like the following (note: big-endian word representation):

Ordinary periodic query

00050004 00010000 00040006 6b616562 : ............beak
                         ^
                         length of following string
6fae7265 00003eb9                   : er.o.>..

Clearly, the host broadcasting the data occurs at byte 12 in the block with
the length of the hostname string given in byte 8.
